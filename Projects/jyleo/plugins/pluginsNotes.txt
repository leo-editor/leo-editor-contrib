What is a plugin?

A plugin is a .py file that appears in Leo's plugin subdirectory. Leo tries to
import all such files while starting up. This is done at "start1" time, that
is, in the call to doHook("start1") in the run function in leo.py. Plugins
exist to define "hook code".

What is hook code?

Leo automatically calls hook code at various times during Leo's execution.
Typical hooks are:

- "start2", called at the end of Leo's startup process,
- "command1", called before executing any of Leo's commands
- "idle", called at Tk's idle time, when nothing else is happening,

See the documentation for hooks in this file for full details.

N.B. Plugins can use "start2" hooks to override any of Leo's classes. See
"Overriding functions, methods & classes" in leoPlugins.leo for several
examples of how to do this.

How do plugins work?

Plugins register themselves when Leo imports them using the following code,
which should appear as the outer level of the .py file:

@color

"""A description of this plugin"""

leoPlugins.registerHandler("xxx", onXXX)
__version__ = "1.2"
g.plugin_signon(__name__)
	
@nocolor

Line by line:

1) """A description of this plugin"""

This is a Python doc string describing the plugin. This string becomes the
value of the __name__ attribute for the module (.py file).

2) leoPlugins.registerHandler("xxx", onXXX)

This line registers a handler called onXXX for the hook called "xxx". See the
documentation for hooks for a complete list of hook names that you can use
instead of "xxx". onXXX is the name of a function or method, presumably defined
in the plugin file, that Leo will call at "xxx" time. For example:

leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle",onIdle)

will cause Leo to call the onIdle function at "idle" time.

You can pass a list of hook names as the first argument to leoPlugins.registerHandler. For
example:

leoPlugins.registerHandler(("bodykey1","bodykey2","headkey1","headkey2"), onKey)

3) __version__ = "1.2"

This assigns a version attribute to module. At present this attribute is used
by the plugin code that creates Leo's Plugins menu.

4) g.plugin_signon(__name__)

This line increases the count of loaded modules. The present code for
plugin_signon does not actually print separate signons--it seems to verbose.

About hook handlers

See the "About hooks" section of leoPlugins.leo for full documentation about
how to write hook handler routines, like onXXX or onKey in the examples above.
Basically, each hook should have this pattern:
	
@color

def onXXX (tag,keywords):
	c = keywords.get("c")
	otherKeyword = keywords.get("otherKeyword")
	<< do something with c and otherKeyword, etc. >>
	
@nocolor

In other words, keywords is a Python dictionary containing the keyword
arguments passed to the hook handler. See the See the "About hooks" section of
leoPlugins.leo for a list of the keywords passed to each hook handler.

The tag is the name of the hook. For example, tag would one of
"bodykey1","bodykey2","headkey1","headkey2", for the onKey hook handler in the
example above.

What's next?

It's one thing to know how to create a plugin. It's another to know how to
actually change Leo. Obviously, some study is needed. The place to start your
study is LeoPy.leo. In particular, study very carefully the section called
"Overview of code". Leo is a highly modular program, and Python is ideally
suited to this style of programming.

#@+node:edream.110203113231.5:Intro to scripts
@nocolor

Scripting is fully documented in Leo's Users Guide, and the following should be enough to get you started:

@color

top() # The commander of the top (current) windows.
top().rootVnode() # The root vnode of the outline.
top().currentVnode() # The presently selected vnode.

@nocolor

If v is any vnode:
	
@color

v.headString() # is the headline of v.
v.bodyString() # is the body of v.
v.threadNext() # is node after v in outline order.

@nocolor

For example, this prints every headline of an outline:
	
@color

v = top().rootVnode()
while v:
	print v.headString()
	v = v.threadNext()
#@-node:edream.110203113231.5:Intro to scripts
#@+node:edream.110203113231.6:About hooks
At startup time Leo looks all files of the form mod_*.py in the plugins
directory. Leo assumes that these files are "plugins" containing Python modules
that customizes Leo's operation. Leo attempts to import each file.

Each module should register routines that are called at various times during
execution. Such times are identified by strings known as "tags". The code in in
one or more plugins corresponding to each tag are known as the "hook" routines
for that tag. Leo catches exceptions (including syntax errors) in hook
routines, so it is safe to hack away on this code.

Leo passes two argument to all hook routines: the tag and a keywords dictionary
containing additional information. For example, keywords["label"] indicates the
kind of command for "command1" and "command2" hooks.

For some hooks, returning anything other than None "overrides" Leo's default
action. Hooks have full access to all of Leo's source code. Just import the
relevant file. For example, top() returns the commander for the topmost Leo
window.

The following table summarizes the arguments passed to hooks: ( Overrides is
"yes" if returning anything other than None overrides Leo's normal command or
event processing.)

The following hooks are a new breed of hook, called "stub hooks". Conceptually,
these hooks are like calls to stub routines that can be filled in by code in
plugins.

tag argument                                                   keys in keywords
(hook name)             overrides    when called               dictionary argument
---------               ---------    -----------               -------------------

"create-optional-menus"  no          (note 8)                  (note 8)

"draw-outine-box"        yes         start of drawBox          tree,p,v,x,y (note 6)
"draw-outline-icon"      yes         start of tree.drawIcon    tree,p,v,x,y (note 6)
"draw-outline-node"      yes         start of tree.drawNode    tree,p,v,x,y (note 6)
"draw-outline-text-box"  yes         start of tree.drawText    tree,p,v,x,y (note 6)
"draw-sub-outline"       yes         start of tree.drawTree    tree,p,v,x,y,h,level,hoistFlag(note 6)
"redraw-entire-outline"  yes         start of tree.redraw      c (note 6)

"color-optional-markup"  yes *       (note 7)                  colorer,v (note 7)
"init-color-markup"      no          (note 7)                  colorer,v,s,i,j,colortag (note 7)

"new"                    no          start of New command      old_c,new_c (note 9)

"scan-directives"        no          in scanDirectives         c,v,s,old_dict,dict,pluginsList (note 10)

Notes:

(1) "activate" and "deactivate" hooks: These have been removed because they do
not work as expected.

(2) "commands" hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
"canonicalized" form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
with all non-alphabetic characters removed.

Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands "undo" and "redo"
rather than "cantundo" and "cantredo".

(3) "menu1" hook: Setting g.app().realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
translating menu names to other languages. Note: the "new" names created this
way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do _not_ affect how
you specify shortcuts in leoConfig.txt, nor do they affect the "official"
command names passed in g.app().commandName. For example, suppose you set
g.app().realMenuNameDict["Open..."] = "Ouvre".

(4) "open1" and "open2" hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing
the following entries:

old_c: The commander of the previously open window.
new_c: The commander of the newly opened window.
fileName: The name of the file being opened.

You can use old_c.currentVnode() and new_c.currentVnode() to get the current
vnode in the old and new windows.

Leo calls the "open1" and "open2" hooks only if the file is already open.
Leo will also call the "open1" and "open2" hooks if:
a) a file is opened using the Recent Files menu and
b) the file is not already open.

(5) "@url1" and "@url2" hooks are only executed if "icondclick1" hook returns
None.

(6) These stub hooks allow plugins to revise or completely replace how Leo
draws outlines. For example, you could change tree.drawIcon to add additional
icons. These stub hooks are really methods of the leoTree class, with the
"tree" keyword corresponding to the "self" parameter. These stub hooks are
called at the beginning of the indicated method. See the method themselves for
a description of the paramters.

(7) These stub hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup withing doc
parts, comments and Python """ strings. Note that these hooks are _not_ called
in Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of
how to use these hooks.

(8) The "create-optional-menus" stub hook is called when Leo is creating menus,
at the place at which creating new menus is appropriate. Therefore, this hook
need only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the
placement of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu
plugins for examples of how to use this hook. Leo now executes hooks in
alphabetical order, so that the Plugins menu will be created before the Scripts
menu.

(9) The "new" stub hook is called at the beginning of the code that implements
the New command. This provides a much easier way of recognizing when Leo is
about to create a new Leo window.

(10) The "scan-directives" stub hooks is called inside the scanDirectives
global function. The dictionary returned by scanDirectives now contains an item
whose key is "pluginsList". The value of this item is a list of tuples
(d,v,s,k) where:

- d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
- v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
- s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive. k has already
been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
the "scan-directives" stub hook.

#@+node:ekr.20040401054523:New coding conventions for plugins
@nocolor

Leo 4.2 uses new coding conventions internally.  I recommend using the new coding conventions in all plugins, although the old way will work inside LeoPlugins.leo.

The new way replaces:
	
from leoPlugins import *
from leoGlobals import *

with:

import leoPlugins
import leoGlobals as g

This removes a major source of namespace pollution and it makes clear where all functions are defined.  To access functions in leoGlobals.py you must preceed the names of such functions with g. N.B. script in the node called

"Script to find and replace all functions in leoGlobals.py"

does this for you. This script make replacements only in a named, top-level subtree.  To change the name of the subtree change the name of the argument in the statement:

p = g.findTopLevelNode("New or improved in 4.2")

Besides changing the imports as shown above, you should do the following:

1. Change app or app() to g.app

2. Change registerHandler(...) to leoPlugins.registerHandler(...)

3. The new standard for importing and using Tkinter is as follows:

try: import Tkinter as Tk
except ImportError: Tk = None

if Tk:
	if g.app.gui is None:
		g.app.createTkGui(__file__)
	
	if g.app.gui.guiName() == "tkinter":
		leoPlugins.registerHandler(...)
		g.plugin_signon(__name__)

This means that the code would refer to Tk.widget instead of Tkinter.widget.  Also, please avoid the use of the completely useless Tk constants such as Tk.RIGHT, Tk.TOP.  Use "right" or "top" instead.

Typical calls to functions in leoGlobals.py include the following:

g.plugin_signon(__name__)
g.es(...) # etc.

Please use @file trees unless you _must_ use an @root tree for some reason.
Please put each class, method and function in a separate node.

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2295621
By: billp9619

As I was explaining my ideas about opml it occurred to me that it uses DIV tags
and a Javascript as the output of the stylesheet.

But then that is what ALL the HTML collapsing outlines use! So the html behavior
is nothing special to opml...it is a behavior of scripted DIV tags in html.

I found a style sheet named outline_leo,xsl on my computer. This is really tiny
and works pretty good. Don't know where I got it from though.
 
Anyway, as I expected the insertion of a html FORM  and a  TEXTAREA box into
one of these DIV tags would collapse out of sight then reappear when clicked
just like any other node.. Actually this is one of those odd things that maybe
noone ever thought of trying,,,,I've never seen it in one of these html outlines
before.

Interestingly, the familiar collapsing xml display in Internet Explorer is really
just a xsl stylesheet and  produces DIV tags and a script like all these other
html outlines. Somewhere I found a version with minor revisions to make it work
with standard xpath.

There is a program called xpathvisualizer that runs in IE and gives basically
the same xml display but highlights an inputted xpath expression. With this
you can view source and see the script and DIV tags.

At the end of the day the only benefit to opml is that others are using
it (standard?) and perhaps  there is something especially good about its Javascript
implementation.

BTW, to load leo into internet explorer just save a copy with an .xml file extension.
Then drag it to IE.
And of course the file  could have an embedded xml-stylesheet instruction to
use leo_outline.xsl which just shows headlines, etc,

Also BTW... I have been using Python for some time now but I don't know if i
can handle plug-in development at this stage.  :-)

(But I might be up to refining the html/script environment further. )

Leo's @file concept is very powerful but there are numerous occasions when the user wants to read and write outlines in specialized formats which cannot be handled using the @comment, @first etc directives. Examples would be,

- exporting to restructured text (where additional markup steps are required
- exporting to MS Word
- custom file formats/XML which require restructuring before input/output

Currently there exist two approaches to get around this,

1. Use tangle_done (or other script) to post-process the file - not very efficient since all knowledge of the structure of the outline has to be reinvented by the tangle_done script

2. Use a plugin (eg rst or mod_wordexport) - more efficient but still not ideal since each plugin writer ends up spinning his/her own node traversal scheme and strategy for handling directives, <<headers>> etc


#@-node:ekr.20040331072431.2:Summary of the problem
#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.3:Proposed solution
The solution proposed here is to allow handlers to register themselves to hook into the process of deriving/underiving a file. Handlers would be dispatched on a file type basis (determined by the file extension) and would be able to take over all or part of the (un)derivation process. 

The tricky part of the proposal is to design the hooks to allow the user enough control to completely redefine the format of the derived file whilst not requiring them to rewrite the hard parts of the @file code.

Based on the proof-of-concept example presented here, the following hooks may be sufficient for writing,

1. start (begining to derive a file)
2. body (complete handling of the body)
3. sentinel (handle a sentinel)
4. line (handle a line or part of a line)
5. startnode (when a new node is being processed)
6. endnode (the node and all its children have been processed)
7. end (ready to write the file)


At this time it is not clear whether hooking the read code is actually the best way to go - it may be that the handler would have to override the entire read process.

#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.4:Proof-of-concept
A proof-of-concept has been built to try out the feasibility on the writing side. The example chosen is to write a FreeMind file. FreeMind (freemind.sourceforge.net) is an open source mind-mapping program which fits very well with Leo as an outlining system. A two-way link between the two would offer interesting possibilities.

The FreeMind file is an XML file which is very similar to Leo's. It would be rather easy to write a converter but it serves as a good starting point.
#@nonl
#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.5:Base Implementation
The code is implemented as a plugin which subclasses leoAtFile.baseNewDerivedFile and replaces it. The new class implements a dispatching mechanism similar to the plugin system itself, allowing handlers to register themselves to take over various stages of the derivation process.

Most of the heavy lifting is done in the _doDispatch method which checks to see if a handler is available for the current action for the current file type.

Many of the method of baseNewDerivedFile are override to pass through _doDispatch. In addition, it was necessary to wrap some methods in pre and post calls to allow, for example, the startnode and endnode functions.

One example of this is putAtOthersChild.


A slightly more ugly wrapping of the 'write' method was required since this method performs many actions which we would like to control. In this case these methods had to be switched out with dummy calls so that the handler could call them when it required.

#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.9:Handler calls
Handler clients register themselves using the registerDispatcher call which takes three parameters

- extension (the file extension to register for)
- ontype (the handler event to hook, see declarations)
- handler (the function to recieve the call)


In addition, a convenience blank handler (ie ignore the event) can be inserted by calling the registerNullDispatcher for a particular extension and ontype.

#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.13:FreeMind Implementation
The FreeMind example shows that the plugin begins by registering its dispatchers. It is then called during the normal process of deriving a file (with a ".mm" extension).

It hooks nearly all the events with the exception of body (see the child of this node for a discussion of why not!). The handler functions are rather simple although I took a slightly more complex route than is required in order to exercise all the events.

The implementation builds a separate node structure to represent the tree and then writes this out when the process is complete.
#@nonl
#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.14:Hooking the body call
This hooks the putBody method call. It is tough to override this as this basically means the handler must do all the hard work of traversing the tree and remembering to call v.setVisited. Finer control of this process is probably a good idea since getting someone to override this properly is quite tricky.

1. It works for writing the derived file.

2. The handler code is pretty clean and doesn't require the handler writer to know about the internals of the @file writing code.

3. Overriding "putBody" is probably a bit too tough to expect people to do.

4. It isn't clear that the same approach will work for reading derived files. This might have to be delegated completely to the handler.

#@+node:ekr.20040331072431.16:Next steps
I want to try out something on the read side (mainly because I want to see if I can get a two way link with FreeMind!). This would complete the proof-of-concept and achieve the aim, which was to demonstrate that Leo could incorporate custom handlers for derived files without any structural changes.

Following that a more complete implementation could be put together if this is thought to be a valuable way to go.

#@+node:ekr.20040320075528:Documentation
@nocolor

This plugin implements a word completion scheme for Leo. In the body pane you
have two new options,

* F4 - complete a dotted word (eg type "self." followed F4 will cycle through
the methods and attributes of an object)

* F5 - complete a stand alone word (eg type "imp" followed by F5 will cycle
though some standard words ... import etc)

Pressing F4 with a partial g.match (eg "os.pa") will cycle through the methods
begining with "pa".

The plugin works by scanning the Leo file to look for words and objects. Hence
you will only get things that have been referencing in the Leo file already.
The scanning currently takes place at file load so any new things you add wont
get added to the list until you reload.

If there is more than one word suggestions then repeatedly pressing F4/F5 will
cycle through them. The order is from the most to the least used so the most
frequently used words should appear first. Once you reach the end it stops.

@nocolor

Why two keys? I tried the get the "dotted completion" to work when you press
the "." key but I couldn't stop the "." appearing in the body as well. The code
is all there so if someone knows the trick then you can just enable this by
adding and appropriate <bind>.

The completion is "python style", ie it doesn't try to know anything about the
source - it just looks for likely looking combinations. For other languages
(php, java etc) you could be smarter. If you feel inclined then you can create
a custom completer by subclassing the basic class used (Extender) and adding
another WordCompleter class.

Changes made:

EKR: 3/20/04

- Converted to @file.
	- Used @others where possible.
	- Removed unused sections.
- Coverted to "import leoGlobals as g" style.
	- Used g.trace rather than most calls to es.

- Fixed bug in split.
- Fixed bug in suggestWords

I don't understand the code yet, but already I love this plugin!

 Non-ASCII in plugin config   
2004-03-25 23:34  

 I run Leo 4.1 final, build 1.77 ,
Python 2.3.0, Tk 8.4.3, on windows 98.

For some reason i had to enter non-ascii string in plugin preferences box (header_style for word export plugin, since ms word is localized and has style names different from "Header"). 

I found that the dialog doesn't close on OK button, and the ini file gets broken -- not all options remain there. 

As i investigated, ConfigParser.write() method when writing to a file claimed it can't convert unicode string to ascii. This problem was fixed by setting system default locale in site.py, (s/if: 0/if: 1/ at line 321).

The fix:

in << Create widgets for each section and option >>:

e = Tk.Entry(b)
e.insert(0, unicode(config.get(section, option)))
